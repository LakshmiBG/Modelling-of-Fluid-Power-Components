# Modelling-of-Fluid-Power-Components
The system to be modelled is presented in the figure below, it is a hydraulic circuit of a system.  The model includes a 4/3-proportional directionvalve,  2-way  hydraulic  cylinder,  a  mechanism  and  a  pressure  source.  Input  for  the  model  is  thecontrol  signal  for  the  valve  (u_valve).  The  model  will  calculate  all  the  desired  outputs  (pressures,forces, cylinder position and velocity, and flow rates.
